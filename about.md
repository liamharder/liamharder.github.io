<h1>My Journey</h1>

---

As a student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from KPU, I have received schooling in all manner of technical skills from object-oriented programming and database design to server and network setup and administration. My strongest skills and deepest passions lie primarily in the field of programming, particularly in Java as that is the language the vast majority of my classes are taught in. While my primary focus is IT, I've also been known to dabble in a handful of other disciplines; predominantly physics and creative writing, though I've also taken courses on subjects as wide ranging as forensic anthropology and citizen journalism.

My academic accomplishments include maintaining a cumulative GPA of 4.05 for over 5 years of study along with 6 placements on the Dean's Honour Roll, while my extracurricular achievements include several months of volunteer experience providing technical support for the White Rock chapter of the Centre for Spiritual Living and providing programming tutoring to at-risk youth at an inner-city school near my home. In my free time, I enjoy a handful of creative pursuits including creative writing and miniature painting. I'm also an avid player of tabletop roleplaying games, and have extensive experience running immersive and engaging campaigns for my friends - several of which have continued for several years.

For as long as I can remember, the siren song of interactive media has enthralled me. To me, the pinnacle of the human experience is our ability to dive into other worlds, to envelop ourselves so thoroughly in the unreal that for the briefest of moments it _becomes_ real. Be it in the form of written literature, recorded cinema, pieces of music - and yes, a well-crafted video game - I can't help but marvel at the human mind's ability to live in these worlds beyond our own, and indeed at our ability to craft these vessels of consciousness for our fellow people to enjoy. My life as it stands is split across both sides of this equation; I feel both the desire to wholly immerse myself in great works of fiction, rich and Tolkienian,  and to create my own works that I might share the joy I feel in doing so with the rest of the world.

In less flowery terms, I aspire to create the kinds of games that will leave my players thinking for days afterwards. To me, the video game represents the latest advancement in creative media and its journey towards richer, fuller immersion. The introduction of film, while certainly less versatile than written novels, allowed for a more direct immersion of audiences into the world the story takes place in by directly stimulating their senses of vision and sound, providing the experience of passively observing the world in which the story takes place. I believe that video games have the ability to take this a step even further, allowing the audience to not only observe but interact with the setting they find themselves in. I find high notes hit the highest and low notes the lowest when I myself experience them, rather than experiencing them by proxy through a character on a screen or page.
