During the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, I joined together with a handful of my friends for a semi-reguler "writing circle" as a creative outlet and a form of socialization. We each provided a list of writing prompts, either existing ones we found online that looked interesting or ones we came up with ourselves, then randomly selected a prompt that we would each then expand out into a 1-3 page short story. Afterwards, we would meet online to share our work and compare our interpretations of the prompt. We continued this tradition from 2021 through to 2022, during which I produced several works across a variety of genres and themes.

Below are some of my personal favourite pieces produced during this time period along with the prompts that inspired them, provided as a sample of the creative works I am able to produce.
