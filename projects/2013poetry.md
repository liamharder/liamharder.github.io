Back in 2013, nearly half a lifetime ago, I entered a submission into a chapbook poetry contest organized by the Poetry Institute of Canada. My poem, a work titled _Look_ _Up_, was deemed worthy of inclusion in the final compilation (entitled The Seasons and Me, Vol II) and was subsequently published.
Regrettably, it seems that the years that followed were not kind to the Institute nor its works. My parents naturally own several physical copies of the published book, allowing me to confirm both the book's existence along with its ISBN number (978-1-926774-24-4), but there appears to be no digital record of the compilation ever existing.
In any case, this compilation marks my first foray into the world of creative writing and self-expression, a trend which has continued in some capacity to this day. I will continue in my efforts to track down any records I can relating to the physical publication; for now, I will be happy to supply further details upon request.
