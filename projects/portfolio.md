I coded this website myself using the Jekyll static site generator that comes with GitHub's Pages web hosting service. While I'm certainly no stranger to more traditional website building software like Wix or Wordpress, I always relish the opportunity to get my hands dirty programming the features I want myself. This website is actually my first foray into Jekyll, having taught myself how to use it via following tutorials and experimenting on my own time. 

The result is a visually appealing (at least, I think so) and easily extensible site that I anticipate using for the rest of my professional career. The GitHub repository containing the website's source code can be found either through the link at the top of the page or by clicking [here](https://github.com/liamharder/liamharder.github.io).
